            <p>Oradour Sur Glane, is a village in the Limousin region. The original population was destroyed on 10 June 1944, when 642 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a German Waffen SS company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site but on the orders of the then French President, Charles De Gaulle, the original village has been maintained as a permanent memorial and museum.<br>It is well worth a visit.</p>
